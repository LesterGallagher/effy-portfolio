# Look

On the right, you can see a few small images of my work and when you click on one of the images they get bigger which allows you to see clearer. I know, technology at it's finest. But behold, there is a little line of text on the bottom of the image which says 'read more', this small line of text also serves as a button at the same time. So when you click the little line of text you open a new page where you are able to read about all my work in an organized format. So go ahead, click and have fun!
